Okay, let's revise the PRD for a desktop application (Windows/macOS/Linux) focusing solely on audio input for mood detection and sound output. This simplifies some aspects (like portability) but introduces others (microphone setup, background operation).

**Product Requirements Document: BabySoothe AI (Desktop Edition)**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Status:** Draft

**1. Introduction**

BabySoothe AI (Desktop Edition) is a **desktop application** designed to assist parents and caregivers in soothing infants using a computer located within hearing distance of the baby. The application utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze a baby's vocalizations captured through the **computer's microphone** (built-in or external), infer their likely emotional state (e.g., distressed, fussy, calm), and automatically play appropriate, pre-selected, or user-recorded soothing sounds through the **computer's speakers** to help calm the baby. The goal is to provide a supportive tool for caregivers in a fixed location (e.g., nursery, home office where baby naps), emphasizing that it does not replace essential parental care and attention.

**2. Goals**

*   **User Goal:** Help parents/caregivers soothe their crying or fussy babies using their nearby computer, reducing stress and promoting a calmer environment when they are near the computer setup.
*   **Product Goal:** Accurately detect key baby mood states through audio analysis via the computer's microphone and provide effective, adaptive audio soothing responses via the computer's speakers. Deliver a simple, reliable, and trustworthy user experience on desktop platforms.
*   **Business Goal (Potential):** Achieve user adoption on desktop platforms, gather feedback for improvement, establish trust, and potentially explore premium features or cross-platform synchronization in the future.

**3. User Personas**

*   **Primary: The Home Office Parent (Alex, 35)**
    *   Works from home or has a dedicated computer setup in/near the nursery.
    *   Baby naps nearby while they work or rest.
    *   Needs a tool that can automatically respond to fussiness without requiring constant manual intervention on the computer.
    *   Values clear status indicators and reliable background operation.
*   **Secondary: The Tech-Savvy Parent (Maria, 29)**
    *   Comfortable using desktop software.
    *   May already use the computer for white noise or music for the baby.
    *   Appreciates automation and potential for customization (like adding own sounds).

**4. Key Features & User Stories (Desktop Focus)**

| F01        | AI Mood Detection        | As a parent, I want the app on my computer to listen via the microphone and identify my baby's likely mood (e.g., crying, fussy, calm).              | High           |
| F02        | Adaptive Sound Playback  | As a parent, I want the app to automatically play a soothing sound through my computer speakers based on the detected mood.                         | High           |
| F03        | Soothing Sound Library   | As a parent, I want access to a variety of proven soothing sounds (white noise, nature, womb sounds, lullabies) within the desktop app.          | High           |
| F04        | Manual Sound Selection   | As a parent, I want to be able to manually browse and play sounds from the library using the app interface.                                       | High           |
| F05        | Volume Control & Limiter | As a parent, I want easy volume controls *within the app* and ideally a safety limiter, so the sound is effective but not harmfully loud.           | High           |
| F06        | Timer & Fade Out         | As a parent, I want to set a timer for sound playback with an automatic fade-out, so the sound stops gently after a period.                       | High           |

| F12        | **Microphone Selection** | As a user with multiple microphones, I want to be able to select which microphone the app should use for listening.                               | Medium         |

**5. Functional Requirements**

*   **5.1 Audio Input:**
    *   REQ-F01.1: App must request and obtain microphone permissions according to the operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux).
    *   REQ-F12.1: If multiple audio input devices are detected, provide a setting to select the desired microphone. Default to the system's default input device.
    *   REQ-F01.2: App must capture audio input continuously from the selected device when activated ("Listening Mode").
    *   REQ-F01.3: Implement basic noise filtering if feasible.
*   **5.2 AI Mood Detection (F01):**
    *   REQ-F01.4: Utilize an on-device audio classification model suitable for desktop performance.
    *   REQ-F01.5: The model must classify audio segments into MVP categories: `Distressed/Crying`, `Fussy/Whimpering`, `Calm/Neutral`, `Non-Baby/Background Noise`.
    *   REQ-F01.6: The app window (or system tray icon/tooltip) must clearly display the current status (e.g., "Listening", "Detected: Crying", "Playing: White Noise", "Idle").
*   **5.3 Sound Library & Playback (F02, F03, F04):**
    *   REQ-F03.1: Include a curated library of high-quality audio files (~5-10 sounds for MVP).
    *   REQ-F04.1: Provide a simple interface (list/grid) within the app window to browse and manually play sounds.
    *   REQ-F02.1: Define default sound mappings for automatic playback based on detected mood.
    *   REQ-F02.2: Implement smooth audio transitions.
    *   REQ-F07.1: Ensure audio playback continues reliably when the application window is minimized or running in the background (via system tray/menu bar icon).
*   **5.4 Controls & Settings (F05, F06):**
    *   REQ-F05.1: Provide clear UI controls for Start/Stop Listening, Mute/Unmute Playback.
    *   REQ-F05.2: Implement an application-specific volume slider.
    *   REQ-F05.3: Implement a maximum volume setting *within the app*. **Note:** A true hardware limiter is difficult; rely on user awareness and clear warnings about setting appropriate system volume. Recommend a calibration step or visual peak meter.
    *   REQ-F06.1: Allow users to set a playback duration (timer).
    *   REQ-F06.2: Implement gentle fade-out effect.
*   **5.5 Parent Voice Recording (F08 - Post-MVP/Stretch Goal):**
    *   REQ-F08.1: Interface to record audio via the selected computer microphone.
    *   REQ-F08.2: Allow recorded files to be saved locally and integrated into the sound library.
*   **5.6 User Feedback (F09 - Post-MVP/Stretch Goal):**
    *   REQ-F09.1: Simple feedback mechanism within the app UI.
    *   REQ-F09.2: Store feedback locally for potential future analysis/learning.

**6. Non-Functional Requirements**

    *   REQ-NF08: Minimal onboarding explaining core function, microphone placement, and safety.
    *   REQ-NF14: Provide a system tray / menu bar icon for quick status view and basic controls (e.g., Start/Stop Listening, Mute) when the main window is closed or minimized.
*   **6.4 Privacy & Security:**
    *   REQ-NF09: **CRITICAL:** All audio processing MUST happen on the device. No baby audio transmitted externally.
    *   REQ-NF10: User recordings stored locally in a standard user-accessible location (e.g., Documents folder sub-directory).
    *   REQ-NF11: Clear privacy policy accessible within the app.
*   **6.5 Safety:**
    *   REQ-NF12: Emphasize user responsibility for setting appropriate *system* volume. Include strong warnings about potential loudness from computer speakers.

*   Installer/Application package for target OS (e.g., Windows installer, macOS .app).

**9. Future Considerations / Roadmap**

*   Enhanced AI, learning, expanded library (as before).
*   Cross-platform builds (e.g., using Electron, Qt).
*   Audio output device selection (if multiple sound cards/speakers).
